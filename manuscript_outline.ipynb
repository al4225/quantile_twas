    "### 1. **Characterization and Subtyping of Quantile xQTLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: Traditional QTL methods primarily rely on mean-based modeling, which may not fully capture the heterogeneity in gene-to-phenotype regulation. By defining \"pure quantile QTLs,\" we aim to identify regulatory signals that are undetectable with linear regression (LR) and categorize them by regulatory pattern, uncovering potential complexity in genetic regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 **Classification Based on Significance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique LR (not Quantile QTL)**: QTLs showing homogenous effects across quantiles, which are mainly captured by mean-level analysis without significant heterogeneity.\n",
    "- **Unique QR Quantile QTL）**: QTLs that are significant only in QR models but not in LR. These are further divided into:\n",
    "    - **No Mean Effect**: No significant mean-level effect, but strong effects at high or low quantiles.\n",
    "    - **Weak Mean Effect**: QR detects significant effects at extreme quantiles where LR does not reach significance, often suggesting interaction or non-linear effects.\n",
    "- **Both QR and LR Significant (Partially Quantile QTL)**:\n",
    "    - **Homogeneous Effect（not Quantile QTL）**: When LR p-values are substantially smaller than QR, indicating a stable effect across quantiles.\n",
    "    - **Heterogeneous Effect（Quantile QTL）**: QR p-values are substantially smaller than LR, QR shows stronger effects, and reveals quantile-specific variations potentially due to interaction effects or other non-linear modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 **Classification Based on Effect Patterns**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Shift**: QTLs influencing the overall mean without affecting variance, indicative of a global shift in expression.\n",
    "- **Variance Change**: QTLs that increase or decrease variance across the population, often associated with individual-specific or environmental interactions.\n",
    "- **Local Effects**: Significant only within specific quantile ranges, representing context-specific regulatory mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3 **Defining Pure Quantile QTLs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pure Quantile QTLs** are QTLs that are significant only in QR models or that show unique heterogeneity within shared QR and LR significant loci.\n",
    "    - **Unique QR**: Detected by QR but not by LR.\n",
    "    - **Heterogeneous Overlap**: Variants significant in both QR (using Cauchy-combined p-values) and LR models but with **distinct heterogeneity patterns** in QR:\n",
    "        - **Filter Step**: Select variants where p(Cauchy-QR)<p(LR) to ensure that QR provides stronger or unique signals for these loci.\n",
    "        - **Identifying Variance Change**:\n",
    "            - Fit a linear regression model across quantiles: β(τ)=α+γ⋅τ+ϵ.\n",
    "            - If p(γ)<0.05, this indicates significant variance change across quantiles. This approach distinguishes variance-modifying QTLs from simple mean shifts.\n",
    "            - **Validation**: Apply Bootstrap with confidence bands to validate the observed non-linearity and quantify heterogeneity in effect sizes across quantiles.\n",
    "        - **Quantitative Description**: Compute a **Heterogeneity Index** to provide a quantitative measure of the variance change, offering an additional layer of description for effect variability.\n",
    "    - **Identification of Local Effects**: After getting pure QR, for loci significant only in low or high quantile ranges (e.g., 5%-45% or 55%-95%), these can be flagged as having local effects.\n",
    "    - **Summary**: Variants that meet the criteria of unique QR and **Heterogeneous Overlap:** significant QR signals (p(Cauchy-QR) < p(LR)), demonstrate variance change or local effects, and pass heterogeneity validation are classified as **Pure Quantile QTLs**. These loci contribute uniquely to the understanding of genetic effects that vary across expression quantiles and are undetected by traditional LR methods.\n",

    "### 3. **Quantile QTL Reveals Heterogeneity Effects Compared with Linear Approaches**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motivation**: This section aims to demonstrate the distinct advantage of quantile QTL (QR) in capturing heterogeneous regulatory effects that linear regression (LR) might overlook. By comparing QR- and LR-detected signals, we aim to show how QR uniquely contributes to understanding genetic regulation, especially in capturing non-linear and interaction effects.\n",

    "    - **Approach**: Evaluate and annotate unique QR and LR signals within functional regulatory contexts, using tools such as gene set enrichment and pathway analysis. This will highlight how QR captures novel regulatory elements and pathways that are undetected by LR.\n",
    "    - **Functional Comparisons**: By annotating unique QR and LR signals with functional data (e.g., CRISPR, Perturb-seq, Hi-C), we can assess the biological relevance of each signal type. QR-unique signals may reveal specific regulatory mechanisms at certain quantiles, particularly those associated with variability or extreme expression values.\n",

Using Cauchy combination p-values and cross-quantile β(τ) variations, this analysis will pinpoint where QR detects additional layers of genetic effect variability that LR overlooks.\n",
